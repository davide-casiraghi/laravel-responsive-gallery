# Laravel Responsive Gallery
A PHP library to create responsive galleries that are organized into Pinterest like columns.   
To generate the grid is used [Bricklayer.js](http://bricklayer.js.org/).
To open the image in a popup is used [Fancybox 3](https://fancyapps.com/fancybox/3/).

The library replace all the occurrences of this kind of snippet
```
{# gallery src=[holiday_images/london] column_width=[250] gutter=[20] #}
```
With the HTML code of a responsive gallery.
```html
<div class='responsiveGallery bricklayer' data-column-width="250" data-gutter="20">
    <div class='box'>
        <a href='gallery/holidays/IMG_1584.jpg' data-fancybox='images' data-caption=''>
            <img src='gallery/holidays/thumb/IMG_1584.jpg' />
        </a>
    </div>
    <div class='box'>
        <a href='gallery/holidays/IMG_1244.jpg' data-fancybox='images' data-caption=''>
            <img src='gallery/holidays/thumb/IMG_1244.jpg' />
        </a>
    </div>
    ...
</div>
```
